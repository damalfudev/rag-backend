ese approaches required extensive setup, struggled with document variations,
and achieved limited accuracy on complex documents.

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and generative Al has fundamentally transformed IDP capabilities.
Modern Al models can understand document context, handle variations without templates, achieve near-human
accuracy on complex extractions, and adapt to new document types with minimal examples. This shift from rule-
based to intelligence-based processing mea
